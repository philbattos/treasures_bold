						<p>I first learned about Forrest Fenn and his brilliant scheme after reading [article] in 2011. 
							My first reaction was to smile at the boldness and creativity of the idea but i had no interest in becoming a crazed treasure hunter who was always chasing some half-true legend of ancient gold and who always carried around a metal-detector "just in case". 
							Over the next couple weeks, my curiosity and skepticism grew into excitement at the thought of taking up the challenge of finding the chest. 
							I read the poem a few times and convinced myself that: a) I was in the perfect place to look for the treasure, since i lived in the Rocky Mountains, and b) that i would certainly find it if devoted myself to the hunt. 
							Soon, i became mildly obsessed with the thrill of the chase. 
							I bought the book, memorized the poem, and pondered the meaning of the clues whenever i had a free moment. 
							I have had several adventures in search of the chest - and been disappointed every time - but i still have the confidence that i will find it. </p>

						<p>My main method of searching online is think up interpretations of the clues and then find places that correspond to those interpretations by searching the <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic">USGS place name database</a>. 
							For example, i might search for "brown" in New Mexico to get a list of all the places that have "brown" in the name. 
							Then, i often look for those places on <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a> (or another mapping website). 
							When there are many places to consider, this can be a tedious process. 
							So i decided to simplify it by creating Treasure Finder, which combines these two steps into one.</p>

						<p>So now, instead of searching for places and then going to Google Maps to see their location, i can do a search in Treasure Finder and it will find all related places in the USGS place name database and put them all on a map for me, instantly! 
							I've found that this tool saves a lot of time. 
							And i thought that other searchers might appreciate having access to it. 
							So i built a website to share it with other Fenners or anyone else who might find it useful. 
							I designed it with the intention of helping people on the Fenn Treasure hunt but there are other applications that people may want to use it for.</p>
