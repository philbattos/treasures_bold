						<p>I knew exactly where to hide the chest so it would be difficult to find but not impossible. 
							It's in the mountains somewhere north of Santa Fe.
							Indecision is the key to flexibility and that's why I waited so long to secret my cache. George Burns was 100 years old when someone asked him how his health was. 
							He replied, "My health's good, it's my age that's killing me."
							And like Eric Sloane, at age almost-eighty, I figured it was time to act. 
							So I wrote a poem containing nine clues that if followed precisely, will lead to the end of my rainbow and the treasure.

						As I have gone alone in there<br>
						And with my treasures bold,<br>
						I can keep my secret where,<br>
						And hint of riches new and old.<br>
						<br>
						Begin it where warm waters halt<br>
						And take it in the canyon down,<br>
						Not far, but too far to walk.<br>
						Put in below the home of Brown.<br>
						<br>
						From there it's no place for the meek,<br>
						The end is ever drawing nigh;<br>
						There'll be no paddle up your creek,<br>
						Just heavy loads and water high.<br>
						<br>
						If you've been wise and found the blaze,<br>
						Look quickly down, your quest to cease,<br>
						But tarry scant with marvel gaze,<br>
						Just take the chest and go in peace.<br>
						<br>
						So why is it that I must go<br>
						And leave my trove for all to seek?<br>
						<span id="answers">The answers<sup><%= link_to "1", "#footnotes" %></sup> I already know,</span><br>
						I've done it tired, and now I'm weak.<br>
						<br>
						So hear me all and listen good,<br>
						Your effort will be worth the cold.<br>
						If you are brave and in the wood<br>
						I give you title to the gold.<br>
